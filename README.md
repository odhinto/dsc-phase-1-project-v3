**Problem Definition**

Our company's expansion and diversification plans include venturing into the aviation industry to own and operate airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. A key preliminary step for this consideration is risk assesment for different aircrafts to advise which aircrafts pose the lowest risk for the intended business endeavor. This projects seeks to assess risk potential from analysis of aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. 

The primary objective of this exercise is to identify the lowest-risk aircraft for our company to purchase and operate. The following are some of the key considerations we expect to make:


*   Historical accident trends by aircraft type
*   Severity and frequency of accidents
*   Factors contributing to the accidents e.g. weather, pilot error or mechanical failures
*   Any correlations between operational risk and aircraft characteristics

**Data Preprocessing**
This section prepare the provided aviation data for analysis. We intend to do the following:



*   Dataset Overview - Load and understand the data
*   Handling Missing Values using derived domain knowledge and imputation
*   Data Cleaning e.g. standardizing categorical values, deriving useful date data, removing duplicates etc

**Dataset Overview**
It is imperative for us to understand the aviation dataset first i.e.:

*   The data structure e.g. available columns, data types and presence of missing values
*   Identify useful columns to focus on

Data Understanding will prescribe subsequent steps. Simple cleaning procedures e.g. capitalization will be done on the spot (immediately a need is observed) to ensure they are not forgotten. Complex cleaning procedures will be done in the **Data Cleaning** subsection
